# SQL - ALIAS, DISTINCT, LIMIT, AND VIEW
---
## KEYWORDS
- **`ALIAS`** ‚Äì Rename colummn and table names in the result set  
- **`DISTINCT`** ‚Äì returns unique values of records.
- **`LIMIT`** ‚Äì restrict output records in resultset. Limit make sure output has atmost records LIMIT mentions.
- **`VIEW`** ‚Äì store query in sql, can be accessed as a table.
---
## QUERY FORMAT
```sql
--1. ALIAS - use `AS` keyword
SELECT field_name AS alias_column_name
FROM table_name AS alias_table_name;
```
```sql
--2. DISTINCT - use `DISTINCT` keyword
SELECT DISTINCT field_names
FROM table_name;
```
```sql
--3. LIMIT - use `LIMIT`
SELECT column_names
FROM table_name
LIMIT limit_number;
```
```sql
--3. VIEW - use `VIEW` and `AS` keyword
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
QUERY;
```

## TIP
**`Order of Execution`**
1.  `FROM`‚Äì Determines the tables to retrieve data from and performs joins if any.
2.  `SELECT`‚Äì Chooses which columns or expressions to return.
3.  `DISTINCT`‚Äì Removes duplicate rows from the result set.
4.  `LIMIT` - ‚Äì Restricts the number of rows returned or skips rows.

## EXERCISE
Before moving to the exercises, we need a platform with tables and data.  
For this, we have a setup file available inside the same directory: [000 EXECUTE THIS FIRST.md](https://github.com/code4coin/001-SQL-Structured-Query-Language-/blob/main/001%20SQL%20FOR%20DATA%20ENGINEERS/001%20Exercises/000%20EXECUTE%20THIS%20FIRST.md)

---
### 1. Aliasing column name from `employees` table
```sql
SELECT name AS first_name
FROM employees;
```
### 2. Retrieve unique values of year_hired from `employees` table
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT year_hired 
FROM employees;
```
### 4. Retrieve 3 records from `employees` table
```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
LIMIT 3;
```
### 4. Create and retrieve `View` from `employees` table, consisting of columns emp_id and year_hired
```sql
CREATE VIEW employee_hired_years AS
SELECT emp_id, year_hired
FROM employees;

SELECT * 
FROM employee_hired_years;
```
---
## PRACTISE
### 1. Write a query to alias column `year_hired` as `joining_year` from `employees` table
```sql
SELECT year_hired as joining_year
FROM employees;
```
### 2. Retrieve distinct values for `year_hired` as `joining_year` from `employees` table
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT year_hired as joining_year
FROM employees;
```
### 3. Retrieve only 5 distinct values for `year_hired` as `joining_year` from `employees` table
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT year_hired as joining_year
FROM employees
LIMIT 5;
```
### 4. Create `VIEW` for distinct values for `year_hired` as `joining_year` from `employees` table
```sql
CREATE VIEW employee_hired_years AS
SELECT DISTINCT year_hired as joining_year
FROM employees;

SELECT * 
FROM employee_hired_years;
```
