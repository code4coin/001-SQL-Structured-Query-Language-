## üìñDEFINITION
- **Structured Data** ‚Äì Clean, organized data following strict schemas for easy querying  
- **Unstructured Data** ‚Äì Raw, non-schema data that is flexible but harder to analyze  
- **Semi-Structured Data** ‚Äì Data with ad-hoc self-describing structure, balancing flexibility and order  
- **Data Warehouse** ‚Äì Central repository for analytics from multiple sources, optimized for query performance  
- **Data Lake** ‚Äì Storage system for huge volumes of raw data, allows schema-on-read  
- **ETL** ‚Äì Traditional data flow method; transform before loading  
- **ELT** ‚Äì Modern data flow method; load before transforming

## üß±QUERY FORMAT
> Note: These are sample SQL formats for interacting with structured data in relational databases.

```sql
-- Select all columns from a table
SELECT * FROM table_name;

-- Filter data with WHERE
SELECT column1, column2 
FROM table_name 
WHERE condition;

-- Insert data into a table
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2)
VALUES (value1, value2);

-- Update existing data
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1
WHERE condition;

-- Delete data from table
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

## üí°TIP TO REMEMBER
- Structured data ‚Üí Easier analysis, less flexible  
- Unstructured data ‚Üí More flexible, requires preprocessing  
- Semi-structured ‚Üí Balanced, common in NoSQL  
- Warehouses ‚Üí Optimized for queries, denormalized  
- Lakes ‚Üí Optimized for scale and cost, schema-on-read  
- ETL ‚Üí Transform before load, ELT ‚Üí Load then transform

## üí™EXERCISE
Before moving to the exercises, we need a platform with tables and data.  
For this, we have a setup file available inside the same directory: [CLICK AND EXECUTE FILE FIRST](https://github.com/code4coin/001-SQL-Structured-Query-Language-/blob/main/001%20SQL%20FOR%20DATA%20ENGINEERS/002%20SAMPLE%20DATA/001%20MOVIE%20DATA.md)

### Exercises with Solutions

1. List all movies released after 2010. 

‚úÖ Solution:
```sql
SELECT * FROM movies
WHERE release_year > 2010;
```

2. Count the total number of movies per genre. 

‚úÖ Solution:
```sql
SELECT genre, COUNT(*) AS total_movies
FROM movies
GROUP BY genre;
```

3. Find movies with rating above 8.5.

‚úÖ Solution:
```sql
SELECT title, rating
FROM movies
WHERE rating > 8.5;
```

4. Insert a new movie record into the table. 

‚úÖ Solution:
```sql
INSERT INTO movies (title, genre, release_year, rating)
VALUES ('New Movie', 'Action', 2025, 7.8);
```

5. Update the rating of a specific movie. 

‚úÖ Solution:
```sql
UPDATE movies
SET rating = 9.0
WHERE title = 'Inception';
```

6. Delete movies released before 2000. 

‚úÖ Solution:
```sql
DELETE FROM movies
WHERE release_year < 2000;
```

7. List top 5 highest-rated movies. 

‚úÖ Solution:
```sql
SELECT * FROM movies
ORDER BY rating DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

8. Find all movies in the 'Action' genre released after 2015. 

‚úÖ Solution:
```sql
SELECT * FROM movies
WHERE genre = 'Action' AND release_year > 2015;
```

9. Count movies per year and order descending. 

‚úÖ Solution:
```sql
SELECT release_year, COUNT(*) AS total_movies
FROM movies
GROUP BY release_year
ORDER BY total_movies DESC;
```

10. Find average rating per genre. 

‚úÖ Solution:
```sql
SELECT genre, AVG(rating) AS avg_rating
FROM movies
GROUP BY genre;
```
