# Welcome to SQL Library Exercises üìö

This is a beginner-friendly collection of SQL exercises designed to help you master the essentials of working with data.  

You'll start by:

- Retrieving data using **SELECT** statements  
- Filtering, grouping, and joining tables  
- Shaping and transforming data with **calculated columns**, **window functions**, and **CTEs**  
- Manipulating real-world datasets with **INSERT**, **UPDATE**, and **DELETE** while respecting data integrity and transactions  

Each exercise includes clear explanations, annotated solutions, and mini-challenges to reinforce best practices like writing readable code, using indexes wisely, and thinking in sets.  

Whether you're preparing for interviews, automating reports, or building data-driven applications, these exercises will strengthen your understanding of relational logic, improve query performance intuition, and give you practical, repeatable practice to turn raw data into insights.
