# SORTING IN SQL

## üîëKEYWORDS
- **Sorting results**
- **ORDER BY**
- **ASC (Ascending)**
- **DESC (Descending)**
- **Sorting by multiple fields**
- **Order of execution**
---
## üìñDEFINITION
- **Sorting results** ‚Äì Organizing query results in a specific order to make data easier to read and analyze.
- **ORDER BY** ‚Äì SQL keyword used to sort results by one or more columns. By default, it sorts in ascending order.
- **ASC (Ascending)** ‚Äì Sorts data from smallest to largest or A to Z.
- **DESC (Descending)** ‚Äì Sorts data from largest to smallest or Z to A.
- **Sorting by multiple fields** ‚Äì Allows sorting on more than one column; subsequent columns act as tie-breakers.
- **SQL order of execution** ‚Äì Sequence in which SQL processes a query: `FROM` ‚Üí `WHERE` ‚Üí `SELECT` ‚Üí `ORDER BY` ‚Üí `LIMIT`.

## üß±QUERY FORMAT
```sql
-- 1. Basic sorting by a single column
SELECT column_names
FROM table_name
ORDER BY rating DESC;
```
```sql
-- 2. Sorting by multiple columns
SELECT col_01, col_02, col_03
FROM table_name
ORDER BY col_01 DESC, col_02 ASC;
```
```sql
-- 3. Sorting with NULL filtering
SELECT column_names
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY column_name DESC;
```
```sql
-- 4. Sorting without selecting the sorted column
SELECT col_01
FROM table_name
ORDER BY col_02 ASC;
```
```sql
-- 5. Different order for multiple fields
SELECT col_01, col_02, col_03
FROM table_name
ORDER BY col_01 DESC, col_02 ASC;
```

## üí°TIP TO REMEMBER
- ‚ÄúSELECT chooses the columns, ORDER BY chooses the order.
- **ORDER OF EXECUTION: FROM -> WHERE -> SELECT -> ORDER BY -> LIMIT**
- Alias in SELECT? Fine in ORDER BY; not in WHERE - Due to ORDER OF EXECUTION‚Äù
- You do not need to include the column in SELECT to sort by it, but it improves clarity.
- Use ASC for ascending order and DESC for descending order.
- When sorting by multiple columns, the second column acts as a tie-breaker if the first column has duplicate values.
- **NULLs usually sort first in ASC and last in DESC (engine-dependent).**

## üí™EXERCISE
Before moving to the exercises, we need a platform with tables and data.  
For this, we have a setup file available inside the same directory: [CLICK AND EXECUTE FILE FIRST](https://github.com/code4coin/001-SQL-Structured-Query-Language-/blob/main/001%20SQL%20FOR%20DATA%20ENGINEERS/002%20SAMPLE%20DATA/002%20PATRONS%20DATA.md)

###  1. List all movies sorted by rating descending
```sql
SELECT title, rating
FROM movies
ORDER BY rating DESC;
```
###  2. Sort movies by release_year ascending
```sql
SELECT title, release_year
FROM movies
ORDER BY release_year ASC;
```
###  3. Sort movies first by genre ascending, then by rating descending
```sql
SELECT title, genre, rating
FROM movies
ORDER BY genre ASC, rating DESC;
```
###  4. Sort movies by budget descending, ignoring NULL budgets
```sql
SELECT title, budget
FROM movies
WHERE budget IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY budget DESC;
```
