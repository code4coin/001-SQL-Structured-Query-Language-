## üìñDEFINITION  
- **Table relationship** ‚Äì The way in which data/record in one table is connected to data/record in another. Relationships are defined using **primary keys** (unique identifiers) and **foreign keys** (columns that reference primary keys in another table).
- **One-to-Many** ‚Äì one director ‚Üí many movies  
- **Many-to-Many** ‚Äì many movies ‚Üî many actors  
- **Junction Table** ‚Äì `movie_actors` resolves M:N (many-to-many) relationships  
- **Foreign Key** ‚Äì links child rows to parent rows  
- **Normalization** ‚Äì splitting data into related tables to reduce redundancy  
- **Cardinality** ‚Äì how many rows on each side of the relationship (1:1, 1:N, M:N).

## üß±QUERY FORMAT
```sql
-- 1-to-Many: list every movie by a given director
SELECT m.title
FROM   movies m
JOIN   directors d ON m.director_id = d.director_id
WHERE  d.director_name = 'Christopher Nolan';
```
```sql
-- Many-to-Many: list all actors in a movie
SELECT a.actor_name
FROM   actors a
JOIN   movie_actors ma ON a.actor_id = ma.actor_id
WHERE  ma.movie_id = 3;
```
```sql
-- Aggregated M:N: average rating per movie
SELECT m.title,
       ROUND(AVG(r.rating), 2) AS avg_rating
FROM   movies m
JOIN   movie_ratings r ON m.movie_id = r.movie_id
GROUP  BY m.title;
```

## üí°TIP TO REMEMBER
- Think of relationships as LEGO bricks:
    - 1√óN bricks stack vertically (1 director ‚Üí N movies).
    - M√óN plates need a special connector (junction table) to lock together.
- If you see a table that contains two foreign keys (and they reference two different parent tables), it is acting as a bridge table ‚Üí the relationship is many-to-many.
- If a table contains just one foreign key directly referencing another table (and no bridge table is used), it is almost always a one-to-many relationship.

## üí™EXERCISE
Before moving to the exercises, we need a platform with tables and data.  
For this, we have a setup file available inside the same directory: [CLICK AND EXECUTE FILE FIRST](https://github.com/code4coin/001-SQL-Structured-Query-Language-/blob/main/001%20SQL%20FOR%20DATA%20ENGINEERS/002%20SAMPLE%20DATA/001%20MOVIE%20DATA.md)

### 1. Write a query to list all movies and their actors.
```sql
SELECT d.director_name, m.title
FROM directors d
JOIN movies m ON d.director_id = m.director_id;
```
### 2. Write a query to show each movie and its average rating.
```sql
SELECT m.title, a.actor_name
FROM movies m
JOIN movie_actors ma ON m.movie_id = ma.movie_id
JOIN actors a        ON ma.actor_id = a.actor_id;
```
### 3. Find all actors who worked with Christopher Nolan.
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT a.actor_name
FROM actors a
JOIN movie_actors ma ON a.actor_id = ma.actor_id
JOIN movies m        ON ma.movie_id = m.movie_id
JOIN directors d     ON m.director_id = d.director_id
WHERE d.director_name = 'Christopher Nolan';
```

## ‚úÖSOLUTIONS
### 1. Identify & Count Relationships
Write a query that returns:
director name
number of movies directed
average runtime of those movies
```sql
SELECT d.director_name,
       COUNT(m.movie_id)        AS movie_cnt,
       ROUND(AVG(m.runtime_minutes), 1) AS avg_runtime
FROM   directors d
JOIN   movies m ON d.director_id = m.director_id
GROUP  BY d.director_name;
```
### 2. Actor Collaboration Matrix
Find every pair of actors who have worked together in at least one movie.
Return: actor 1 name, actor 2 name, movie title.
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
       a1.actor_name AS actor_1,
       a2.actor_name AS actor_2,
       m.title
FROM   movie_actors ma1
JOIN   movie_actors ma2  ON ma1.movie_id = ma2.movie_id
                           AND ma1.actor_id < ma2.actor_id
JOIN   actors a1         ON ma1.actor_id = a1.actor_id
JOIN   actors a2         ON ma2.actor_id = a2.actor_id
JOIN   movies m          ON m.movie_id = ma1.movie_id
ORDER  BY m.title, actor_1, actor_2;
```
### 3. High-Rated Genre Snapshot
List all genres with an average rating ‚â• 8.0 based on user reviews.
Return: genre, average rating, total reviews.
```sql
SELECT m.genre,
       ROUND(AVG(r.rating), 2) AS avg_rating,
       COUNT(*)                AS total_reviews
FROM   movies m
JOIN   movie_ratings r ON m.movie_id = r.movie_id
GROUP  BY m.genre
HAVING AVG(r.rating) >= 8.0;
