## üìñDEFINITION
- **Filtering Text** ‚Äì Use SQL to select records based on specific text values or patterns in columns. Ideal for searching names, titles, or other string data.  
- **LIKE** ‚Äì Find values that match a specific pattern in a column. Useful for partial matches, e.g., names starting with ‚ÄúJ‚Äù.  
- **NOT LIKE** ‚Äì Exclude values that match a specific pattern in a column. Helps filter out unwanted text results.  
- **IN** ‚Äì Check if a column‚Äôs value exists within a specified list of values. Simplifies multiple OR conditions into a concise query.

## üß±QUERY FORMAT
```sql
-- 1. LIKE query format
  SELECT column_names
    FROM table_name
   WHERE column_name LIKE pattern_detail; 
```
```sql
-- 2. NOT LIKE query format
  SELECT column_names
    FROM table_name
   WHERE column_name NOT LIKE pattern_detail; 
```
```sql
-- 3. IN query format
  SELECT column_names
    FROM table_name
   WHERE column_name IN (list_of_numbers or list_of_text); 
```

## üí°TIP TO REMEMBER
- Use **`%`** to match zero, one, or many characters in a text.
- Use **`_`** to match a single character in a text.
- **NOT LIKE** is case-sensitive.
- **IN** is cleaner than multiple OR conditions for multiple values.
