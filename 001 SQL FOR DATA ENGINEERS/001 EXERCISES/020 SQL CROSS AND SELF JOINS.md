# CROSS AND SELF JOINS
---
## üîëKEYWORDS
- **CROSS JOIN**
- **CARTESIAN PRODUCT**
---
## üìñDEFINITION
- **CROSS JOIN** ‚Äì A type of SQL join that produces all possible combinations of rows from two tables, also called a Cartesian product. Unlike INNER or OUTER JOINs, it does not require any relationship between the tables.
---
## üß±QUERY FORMAT
```sql
SELECT <columns>
FROM   left_table
CROSS JOIN right_table;
```
---
## üí°TIP TO REMEMBER
- A CROSS JOIN multiplies: rows √ó rows = grid.
- Use only when you really need all pairings.
- CROSS JOIN generates all possible combinations of rows.
- Use carefully on large tables to avoid extremely large result sets.
- Can be filtered using WHERE for meaningful combinations.

## üí™EXERCISE
Before moving to the exercises, we need a platform with tables and data.  
For this, we have a setup file available inside the same directory: [CLICK AND EXECUTE FILE FIRST](https://github.com/code4coin/001-SQL-Structured-Query-Language-/blob/main/001%20SQL%20FOR%20DATA%20ENGINEERS/002%20SAMPLE%20DATA/001%20MOVIE%20DATA.md)

### 1. Find all possible combinations of movies and reviewers.
```sql
SELECT m.title AS movie_title, a.actor_name AS actor
FROM movies m
CROSS JOIN actors a
LIMIT 10;
```
### 2. Filter the combinations to only include Action movies and USA actors.
```sql
SELECT m.title AS movie_title, d.director_name AS director
FROM movies m
CROSS JOIN directors d
WHERE m.genre = 'Sci-Fi' AND d.nationality = 'USA';
```
### 3. Count the total number of combinations when CROSS JOINing movies and directors.
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_combinations
FROM movies m
CROSS JOIN directors d;
```

## üß†Practise
1. Show every possible pairing of actor names with movie titles.
2. How many rows are produced when you CROSS JOIN movies and actors?
3. Rewrite exercise 1 using the older comma syntax: FROM actors, movies

FROM   actors AS a
CROSS JOIN movies AS m;
```
### 2. How many rows are produced when you CROSS JOIN movies and actors?

SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows
FROM movies
CROSS JOIN actors;

```
### 3. Rewrite exercise 1 using the older comma syntax: FROM actors, movies
```sql
-- Comma syntax
SELECT a.actor_name,
       m.title
FROM   actors a, movies m;
