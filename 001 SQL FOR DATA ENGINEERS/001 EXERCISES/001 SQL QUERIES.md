# SQL QUERIES

---
## Introducing SQL Queries
Structured data resides inside relational databases hosted on servers. It becomes essential to have a medium of communication with the data.  
Hence, SQL (Structured Query Language) came into existence.

- SQL is a query language, meaning queries are used to interact with data.  
- SQL resembles English, making it easier to read and maintain.  
- It is the industry standard for any relational database.

## SQL Keywords
As mentioned, SQL is a query language, which means you send queries to retrieve information.  
Therefore, it is necessary to keep a few words reserved for specific functions.  
For example, `SELECT` is an SQL keyword used to retrieve information from a table.

## SQL Resultset 
The output returned by a SQL query is called a resultset.

## EXERCISE
Before moving to the exercises, we need a platform with tables and data.  
For this, we have a setup file available inside the same directory: [CLICK AND EXECUTE FILE FIRST](https://github.com/code4coin/001-SQL-Structured-Query-Language-/blob/main/001%20SQL%20FOR%20DATA%20ENGINEERS/002%20SAMPLE%20DATA/002%20PATRONS%20DATA.md)
