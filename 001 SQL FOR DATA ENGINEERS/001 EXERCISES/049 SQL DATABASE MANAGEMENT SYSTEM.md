## üìñDEFINITION

* **DBMS** ‚Äì A software system that allows users to create, maintain, and interact with databases efficiently. It manages the data, database schema, and database engine, serving as an interface between applications and the database.
* **SQL DBMS** ‚Äì Organizes data into tables with rows and columns, uses SQL for queries, and ensures data consistency.
* **NoSQL DBMS** ‚Äì Flexible, schema-less databases for rapidly growing or unstructured data, including types like key-value, document, columnar, and graph databases.

## üß±QUERY FORMAT

* SQL queries follow the standard structure:

```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column_name
ORDER BY column_name;
```

---

## üí°TIP TO REMEMBER

* Use **SQL DBMS** when your data is structured, consistent, and schema is predefined.
* Use **NoSQL DBMS** when your data grows rapidly, is unstructured, or schema may change frequently.
* SQL queries can JOIN multiple tables to retrieve relational data.
