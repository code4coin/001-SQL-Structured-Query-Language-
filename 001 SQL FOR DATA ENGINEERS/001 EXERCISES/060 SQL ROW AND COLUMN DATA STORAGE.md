# ROW AND COLUMN DATA STORAGE
---

## üîëKEYWORDS

* **Row Store**
* **Column Store**
* **Transactional Workload (OLTP)**
* **Analytical Workload (OLAP)**
* **Data Blocks**
* **Data Compression**

---

## üìñDEFINITION

* **Row Store** ‚Äì Data is stored row by row in blocks. Ideal for transactional workloads where individual records are frequently inserted, updated, or deleted.
* **Column Store** ‚Äì Data is stored column by column in blocks. Ideal for analytical workloads, where aggregates and summaries are common, with better compression and faster query speed.

---

## üß±QUERY FORMAT

* Row store queries typically access **all columns for a few rows**.

```sql
SELECT * FROM movies WHERE movie_id = 1;
```

* Column store queries typically access **a few columns for many rows**.

```sql
SELECT AVG(runtime_minutes) AS avg_runtime
FROM movies
WHERE genre = 'Sci-Fi';
```

---

## üí°TIP TO REMEMBER

* Row store = fast for **INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE**
* Column store = fast for **SELECT with aggregates**
* Column store = better **data compression**
* Choose storage format depending on **workload type** (OLTP vs OLAP)

## üí™EXERCISE

Before moving to the exercises, ensure your platform has the tables and data loaded.
For this, we have a setup file available inside the same directory: [CLICK AND EXECUTE FILE FIRST](https://github.com/code4coin/001-SQL-Structured-Query-Language-/blob/main/001%20SQL%20FOR%20DATA%20ENGINEERS/002%20SAMPLE%20DATA/001%20MOVIE%20DATA.md)

## ‚úÖSOLUTIONS

### Practise Solutions

1. Titles of movies with runtime greater than 150 minutes:

```sql
SELECT title
FROM movies
WHERE runtime_minutes > 150;
```

2. Actors in movies directed by 'Quentin Tarantino':

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT a.actor_name
FROM actors a
JOIN movie_actors ma ON a.actor_id = ma.actor_id
JOIN movies m ON ma.movie_id = m.movie_id
JOIN directors d ON m.director_id = d.director_id
WHERE d.director_name = 'Quentin Tarantino';
```

3. Average rating of all 'Sci-Fi' movies:

```sql
SELECT AVG(r.rating) AS avg_rating
FROM movies m
JOIN movie_ratings r ON m.movie_id = r.movie_id
WHERE m.genre = 'Sci-Fi';
```

4. Top 3 longest movies with director name:

```sql
SELECT m.title, m.runtime_minutes, d.director_name
FROM movies m
JOIN directors d ON m.director_id = d.director_id
ORDER BY m.runtime_minutes DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

5. Movies with no ratings:

```sql
SELECT title
FROM movies
WHERE movie_id NOT IN (SELECT movie_id FROM movie_ratings);
```
