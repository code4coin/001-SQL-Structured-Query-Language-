# OUTER JOINS - LEFT, RIGHT AND FULL
---

## üîëKEYWORDS
- **LEFT JOIN** 
- **RIGHT JOIN**
- **FULL JOIN**
- **OUTER**
---
## üìñDEFINITION
- **LEFT JOIN** ‚Äì returns **all** rows from the **left** table plus matching rows from the right table; where no match exists, right-side columns show `NULL`.  
- **RIGHT JOIN** ‚Äì returns **all** rows from the **right** table plus matching rows from the left table; where no match exists, left-side columns show `NULL`.
- **RIGHT JOIN** - returns all rows from both tables, using NULL for unmatched columns.
- **OUTER** ‚Äì unmatched rows are kept; missing columns filled with `NULL` 

---
## üß±QUERY FORMAT
```sql
SELECT column_names
FROM table_main
[LEFT | RIGHT | FULL OUTER] JOIN table_secondary
ON condition;
```
---
## üí°TIP TO REMEMBER
- **Think ‚ÄúLeft keeps left, Right keeps right.‚Äù
Any unmatched side gets NULL.**
- **‚ÄúTake everything from both tables, and fill gaps with NULL.‚Äù**

## üí™EXERCISE
Before moving to the exercises, we need a platform with tables and data.  
For this, we have a setup file available inside the same directory: [CLICK AND EXECUTE FILE FIRST](https://github.com/code4coin/001-SQL-Structured-Query-Language-/blob/main/001%20SQL%20FOR%20DATA%20ENGINEERS/002%20SAMPLE%20DATA/001%20MOVIE%20DATA.md)

### 1. List every movie along with its director‚Äôs name‚Äîeven if the director is unknown (director_id is missing).
```sql
SELECT m.title,
       d.director_name
FROM   movies   AS m
LEFT  JOIN directors AS d
       ON m.director_id = d.director_id;
```
### 2. List every director along with every movie they have directed‚Äîeven if they have directed none yet.
```sql
SELECT d.director_name,
       m.title
FROM   movies   AS m
RIGHT JOIN directors AS d
       ON m.director_id = d.director_id;
```
### 3. Rewrite the second exercise as a LEFT JOIN (swap tables) instead of using RIGHT JOIN.
```sql
-- LEFT JOIN version of exercise 2
SELECT d.director_name,
       m.title
FROM   directors AS d
LEFT  JOIN movies  AS m
       ON d.director_id = m.director_id;
```

NOTE - As of 19-AUG-2025: Platform does not support RIGHT AND FULL OUTER JOINS
### 4. Rewrite the second exercise as a FULL JOIN (swap tables) instead of using RIGHT JOIN.
```sql
-- FULL JOIN version of exercise 2
SELECT d.director_name,
       m.title
FROM   directors AS d
FULL  JOIN movies  AS m
       ON d.director_id = m.director_id;
```

## üß†Practise
1. List all movies and their ratings (include movies even if they don‚Äôt have a rating).
2. List all movies and their directors (include movies even if they don‚Äôt have a director).
3. List all directors and the movies they directed (include directors even if they haven‚Äôt directed a movie).
4. List all movies along with any rating and director information (show NULLs where missing).

## ‚úÖSOLUTIONS
### 1. List all movies and their ratings (include movies even if they don‚Äôt have a rating).
```sql
SELECT m.title, r.rating
FROM movies m
LEFT JOIN movie_ratings r ON m.movie_id = r.movie_id;
```
### 2. List all movies and their directors (include movies even if they don‚Äôt have a director).
```sql
SELECT m.title, d.director_name
FROM movies m
LEFT JOIN directors d ON m.director_id = d.director_id;
```
### 3. List all directors and the movies they directed (include directors even if they haven‚Äôt directed a movie).
```sql
SELECT d.director_name, m.title
FROM directors d
LEFT JOIN movies m ON d.director_id = m.director_id;
```
### 4. List all movies along with any rating and director information (show NULLs where missing).
```sql
SELECT m.title, d.director_name, r.rating
FROM movies m
LEFT JOIN directors d ON m.director_id = d.director_id
LEFT JOIN movie_ratings r ON m.movie_id = r.movie_id;
```
