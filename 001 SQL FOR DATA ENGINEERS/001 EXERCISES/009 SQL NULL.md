- **IS NOT NULL** ‚Äì Filters and selects rows where a column does not contain NULL values. Useful for excluding missing data from analysis.

## üß±QUERY FORMAT
```sql
-- 1. IS NULL query format
SELECT column_names
  FROM table_name
 WHERE column_name IS NULL;
```
```sql
-- 2. IS NOT NULL query format
SELECT column_names
  FROM table_name
 WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL;
```

## üí°TIP TO REMEMBER
- NULL is not the same as 0 or an empty string; it represents missing information.
- Use IS NULL to check for missing values.
- Use IS NOT NULL to focus on records with valid data.
- Counting NULL vs non-NULL values helps ensure accurate analysis.
