## üìñDEFINITION

* **Normalized Database** ‚Äì A database design where tables are divided to reduce redundancy and ensure consistency.
* **Denormalized Database** ‚Äì A database design where tables are combined for faster query performance at the cost of redundancy.
* **OLTP** ‚Äì Online Transaction Processing (write-intensive)
* **OLAP** ‚Äì Online Analytical Processing (read-intensive)
* **Star Schema** ‚Äì Denormalized structure
* **Snowflake Schema** ‚Äì Normalized structure

## üß±QUERY FORMAT

```sql
-- Normalized example
SELECT <columns>
FROM   fact_table
JOIN   dim_table1 ON fact_table.key = dim_table1.key
JOIN   dim_table2 ON fact_table.key = dim_table2.key
WHERE  <filters>;
```
```sql
-- Denormalized example
SELECT <columns>
FROM   wide_table
WHERE  <filters>;
```

## üóÇ Visual Schema Example

**Denormalized (Star Schema)**

TABLE: movies_star
| title     | genre  | director          | actor             | rating |
| --------- | ------ | ----------------- | ----------------- | ------ |
| Inception | Sci-Fi | Christopher Nolan | Leonardo DiCaprio | 9.0    |
| ...       | ...    | ...               | ...               | ...    |


**Normalized (Snowflake Schema)**

TABLES: directors, movies, actors, movie_actors, movie_rating
| directors    | movies        | actors    | movie_actors | movie_ratings |
| ------------ | ------------- | --------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| director_id  | movie_id      | actor_id  | movie_id     | rating_id      |
| name         | title         | name      | actor_id     | movie_id       |
| ...          | genre         | ...       | ...          | user_name      |
|              | director_id   |           |              | rating         |
|              | release_year  |           |              | ...            |

## üí°TIP TO REMEMBER

* **Normalization reduces redundancy** and ensures data integrity.
* **Denormalization improves read performance** for analytics-heavy queries.
* OLTP ‚Üí prefers **normalized tables**.
* OLAP ‚Üí prefers **denormalized tables**.
* More joins = slower queries but safer updates.
