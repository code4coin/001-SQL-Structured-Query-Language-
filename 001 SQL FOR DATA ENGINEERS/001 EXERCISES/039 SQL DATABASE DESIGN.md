## üìñDEFINITION
- **Database Design** ‚Äì The process of structuring data in a logical way for efficient storage, retrieval, and management. It involves schemas, data models, and relationships.  
- **Schema** ‚Äì A blueprint of the database defining tables, fields, and relationships.  
- **Fact Table** ‚Äì Stores measurable data (e.g., ratings).  
- **Dimension Table** ‚Äì Stores descriptive attributes (e.g., movies, directors, actors).  
---
## üß±QUERY FORMAT
Some useful formats in database design:
```sql
-- Example 1: Join tables
SELECT m.title, d.director_name
FROM movies m
JOIN directors d ON m.director_id = d.director_id;
```
```sql
-- Example 2: Aggregation
SELECT genre, AVG(rating) AS avg_rating
FROM movies m
JOIN movie_ratings r ON m.movie_id = r.movie_id
GROUP BY genre;
```
---
## üí°TIP TO REMEMBER
- Always start with a **conceptual model** (entities & relationships).  
- Normalize to reduce redundancy, denormalize for faster queries when needed.  
- In dimensional modeling: **Fact tables change often**, **dimension tables change less**.

## üí™EXERCISE
Before moving to the exercises, we need a platform with tables and data.  
For this, we have a setup file available inside the same directory:  
[CLICK AND EXECUTE FILE FIRST](https://github.com/code4coin/001-SQL-Structured-Query-Language-/blob/main/001%20SQL%20FOR%20DATA%20ENGINEERS/002%20SAMPLE%20DATA/001%20MOVIE%20DATA.md)

### 1. Find all movies directed by *Christopher Nolan*.  
<details>
  <summary>‚úÖ Solution:</summary>

```sql
SELECT m.title, m.release_year
FROM movies m
JOIN directors d ON m.director_id = d.director_id
WHERE d.director_name = 'Christopher Nolan';
```
</details>

---

### 2. List all actors who acted in *Interstellar*.  
<details>
  <summary>‚úÖ Solution:</summary>

```sql
SELECT a.actor_name
FROM actors a
JOIN movie_actors ma ON a.actor_id = ma.actor_id
JOIN movies m ON ma.movie_id = m.movie_id
WHERE m.title = 'Interstellar';
```
</details>

---

### 3. Find the **average rating** of each movie.  
<details>
  <summary>‚úÖ Solution:</summary>

```sql
SELECT m.title, ROUND(AVG(r.rating),2) AS avg_rating
FROM movies m
JOIN movie_ratings r ON m.movie_id = r.movie_id
GROUP BY m.title
ORDER BY avg_rating DESC;
```
</details>

---

### 4. Get the **highest-rated movie** of each director.  
<details>
  <summary>‚úÖ Solution:</summary>

```sql
SELECT d.director_name, m.title, MAX(r.rating) AS top_rating
FROM directors d
JOIN movies m ON d.director_id = m.director_id
JOIN movie_ratings r ON m.movie_id = r.movie_id
GROUP BY d.director_name, m.title
ORDER BY d.director_name, top_rating DESC;
```
</details>
