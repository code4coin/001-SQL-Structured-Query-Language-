## üìñDEFINITION
- **Kimball‚Äôs Four-Step Process** ‚Äì A systematic method to design dimensional models for data warehouses by:
  1. Selecting the organizational process.  
  2. Declaring the grain (level of detail).  
  3. Identifying the dimensions.  
  4. Identifying the facts.  

This approach ensures business-focused and analysis-ready data marts.

## üß±QUERY FORMAT
The general SQL approach to apply Kimball‚Äôs method:  

```sql
-- Step 1: Select Process
-- Example: Analyzing movie ratings

-- Step 2: Declare Grain
-- Grain: One row per user‚Äôs rating of a movie per date

-- Step 3: Identify Dimensions
SELECT m.title, d.director_name, mr.user_name, mr.review_date
FROM movies m
JOIN directors d ON m.director_id = d.director_id
JOIN movie_ratings mr ON m.movie_id = mr.movie_id;

-- Step 4: Identify Facts
SELECT m.title, COUNT(mr.rating) AS total_reviews, 
       AVG(mr.rating) AS avg_rating
FROM movies m
JOIN movie_ratings mr ON m.movie_id = mr.movie_id
GROUP BY m.title
ORDER BY avg_rating DESC;
```

---

## üí°TIP TO REMEMBER
- Always **declare the grain first** before selecting facts, otherwise metrics may not align.  
- Dimensions = **context** (Who, What, Where, When).  
- Facts = **measurements** (How much, How many).  
- Work closely with **business users** to ensure data marts are relevant.

## üí™EXERCISE
Before moving to the exercises, we need a platform with tables and data.  
For this, we have a setup file available inside the same directory: [CLICK AND EXECUTE FILE FIRST](https://github.com/code4coin/001-SQL-Structured-Query-Language-/blob/main/001%20SQL%20FOR%20DATA%20ENGINEERS/002%20SAMPLE%20DATA/001%20MOVIE%20DATA.md)  

### 1. Find the top 3 movies with the highest average ratings.  
<details>
  <summary>‚úÖ Solution:</summary>
  
```sql
SELECT m.title, AVG(mr.rating) AS avg_rating
FROM movies m
JOIN movie_ratings mr ON m.movie_id = mr.movie_id
GROUP BY m.title
ORDER BY avg_rating DESC
LIMIT 3;
```
</details>

### 2. Show each director with the total number of movies they directed.  
<details>
  <summary>‚úÖ Solution:</summary>
  
```sql
SELECT d.director_name, COUNT(m.movie_id) AS total_movies
FROM directors d
JOIN movies m ON d.director_id = m.director_id
GROUP BY d.director_name
ORDER BY total_movies DESC;
```
</details>

### 3. List all actors who appeared in movies directed by *Christopher Nolan*.  
<details>
  <summary>‚úÖ Solution:</summary>
  
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT a.actor_name
FROM actors a
JOIN movie_actors ma ON a.actor_id = ma.actor_id
JOIN movies m ON ma.movie_id = m.movie_id
JOIN directors d ON m.director_id = d.director_id
WHERE d.director_name = 'Christopher Nolan';
```
</details>

### 4. For each year, find the movie with the highest average rating. 
<details>
  <summary>‚úÖ Solution:</summary>
  
```sql
SELECT m.release_year, m.title, AVG(mr.rating) AS avg_rating
FROM movies m
JOIN movie_ratings mr ON m.movie_id = mr.movie_id
GROUP BY m.release_year, m.title
HAVING AVG(mr.rating) = (
    SELECT MAX(sub.avg_rating)
    FROM (
        SELECT m2.release_year, m2.title, AVG(mr2.rating) AS avg_rating
        FROM movies m2
        JOIN movie_ratings mr2 ON m2.movie_id = mr2.movie_id
        GROUP BY m2.release_year, m2.title
        HAVING m2.release_year = m.release_year
    ) sub
)
ORDER BY m.release_year;
```
</details>

## üß†Practise
1. Find the number of reviews given by each user.  
2. Which actor has acted in the most number of movies?

## ‚úÖSOLUTIONS

### 1. Find the number of reviews given by each user.  
```sql
SELECT mr.user_name, COUNT(mr.rating) AS total_reviews
FROM movie_ratings mr
GROUP BY mr.user_name
ORDER BY total_reviews DESC;
```

### 2. Which actor has acted in the most number of movies?  
```sql
SELECT a.actor_name, COUNT(ma.movie_id) AS total_movies
FROM actors a
JOIN movie_actors ma ON a.actor_id = ma.actor_id
GROUP BY a.actor_name
ORDER BY total_movies DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

### 3. List all movies released after 2010 with an average rating above 9.0.  
```sql
SELECT m.title, AVG(mr.rating) AS avg_rating
FROM movies m
JOIN movie_ratings mr ON m.movie_id = mr.movie_id
WHERE m.release_year > 2010
GROUP BY m.title
HAVING AVG(mr.rating) > 9.0
ORDER BY avg_rating DESC;
```

### 4. Show the top 2 directors with the highest-rated movies on average.  
```sql
SELECT d.director_name, AVG(mr.rating) AS avg_rating
FROM directors d
JOIN movies m ON d.director_id = m.director_id
JOIN movie_ratings mr ON m.movie_id = mr.movie_id
GROUP BY d.director_name
ORDER BY avg_rating DESC
LIMIT 2;
```
