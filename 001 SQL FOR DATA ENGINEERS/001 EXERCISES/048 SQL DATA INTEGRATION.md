## üìñDEFINITION

* **Data Integration** ‚Äì The process of combining data from different sources, formats, or technologies to provide a consistent and unified view for users and applications.
* **Unified Data Model** ‚Äì A consolidated data structure for analysis and reporting.
* **ETL** ‚Äì Extract, Transform, Load.
* **Transformation** ‚Äì Converting source data to fit the unified model.
* **Lineage** ‚Äì Tracking data origin and usage.
* **Update Cadence** ‚Äì Frequency of data updates.

## üß±QUERY FORMAT

Basic SQL format to query integrated data:

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM source_table
JOIN another_table ON condition
WHERE conditions
GROUP BY columns
ORDER BY columns;
```

---

## üí°TIP TO REMEMBER

* Always define your **final goal** before integrating data (dashboards, reports, or products).
* Keep track of **update cadence** for each source.
* Ensure **security** and **lineage** are maintained during ETL.
* Use **automated testing** to verify transformations.

## üí™EXERCISE

Before moving to the exercises, we need a platform with tables and data.
For this, we have a setup file available inside the same directory: [CLICK AND EXECUTE FILE FIRST](https://github.com/code4coin/001-SQL-Structured-Query-Language-/blob/main/001%20SQL%20FOR%20DATA%20ENGINEERS/002%20SAMPLE%20DATA/001%20MOVIE%20DATA.md)

### 1. Create a unified view of movies with their directors, actors, and average rating.

<details>
  <summary>‚úÖ Solution:</summary>
  
  ```sql
  SELECT
      m.title,
      d.director_name,
      STRING_AGG(a.actor_name, ', ') AS actors,
      AVG(r.rating) AS avg_rating
  FROM movies m
  JOIN directors d ON m.director_id = d.director_id
  JOIN movie_actors ma ON m.movie_id = ma.movie_id
  JOIN actors a ON ma.actor_id = a.actor_id
  LEFT JOIN movie_ratings r ON m.movie_id = r.movie_id
  GROUP BY m.movie_id, d.director_name, m.title;
  ```
</details>

### 2. List all movies released after 2010 with ratings above 9.

<details>
  <summary>‚úÖ Solution:</summary>
  
  ```sql
  SELECT m.title, AVG(r.rating) AS avg_rating
  FROM movies m
  JOIN movie_ratings r ON m.movie_id = r.movie_id
  WHERE m.release_year > 2010
  GROUP BY m.title
  HAVING AVG(r.rating) > 9;
  ```
</details>

### 3. Find all actors who have worked with Christopher Nolan.

<details>
  <summary>‚úÖ Solution:</summary>
  
  ```sql
  SELECT DISTINCT a.actor_name
  FROM actors a
  JOIN movie_actors ma ON a.actor_id = ma.actor_id
  JOIN movies m ON ma.movie_id = m.movie_id
  JOIN directors d ON m.director_id = d.director_id
  WHERE d.director_name = 'Christopher Nolan';
  ```
</details>

### 4. Get the top 3 highest-rated movies.

<details>
  <summary>‚úÖ Solution:</summary>
  
  ```sql
  SELECT m.title, AVG(r.rating) AS avg_rating
  FROM movies m
  JOIN movie_ratings r ON m.movie_id = r.movie_id
  GROUP BY m.title
  ORDER BY avg_rating DESC
  LIMIT 3;
  ```
</details>

### 5. Count the number of movies per genre.

<details>
  <summary>‚úÖ Solution:</summary>
  
  ```sql
  SELECT genre, COUNT(*) AS total_movies
  FROM movies
  GROUP BY genre;
  ```
</details>

### Practice Solutions

1. **Find all movies and their director nationality:**

```sql
SELECT m.title, d.nationality AS director_nationality
FROM movies m
JOIN directors d ON m.director_id = d.director_id;
```

2. **List movies with more than one actor:**

```sql
SELECT m.title, COUNT(ma.actor_id) AS actor_count
FROM movies m
JOIN movie_actors ma ON m.movie_id = ma.movie_id
GROUP BY m.title
HAVING COUNT(ma.actor_id) > 1;
```

3. **Retrieve the average rating per director:**

```sql
SELECT d.director_name, AVG(r.rating) AS avg_rating
FROM directors d
JOIN movies m ON d.director_id = m.director_id
JOIN movie_ratings r ON m.movie_id = r.movie_id
GROUP BY d.director_name;
```

4. **Find actors who acted in movies rated above 9:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT a.actor_name
FROM actors a
JOIN movie_actors ma ON a.actor_id = ma.actor_id
JOIN movie_ratings r ON ma.movie_id = r.movie_id
WHERE r.rating > 9;
```

5. **List all movies along with the number of actors in each movie:**

```sql
SELECT m.title, COUNT(ma.actor_id) AS actor_count
FROM movies m
JOIN movie_actors ma ON m.movie_id = ma.movie_id
GROUP BY m.title;
```

6. **Retrieve all movies that have no ratings yet:**

```sql
SELECT m.title
FROM movies m
LEFT JOIN movie_ratings r ON m.movie_id = r.movie_id
WHERE r.rating IS NULL;
```

7. **Find the earliest released movie per genre:**

```sql
SELECT genre, MIN(release_year) AS earliest_year
FROM movies
GROUP BY genre;
```

8. **Get the total number of ratings per user:**

```sql
SELECT user_name, COUNT(*) AS total_ratings
FROM movie_ratings
GROUP BY user_name;
```
