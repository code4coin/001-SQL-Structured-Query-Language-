## üìñDEFINITION

* **Star Schema** ‚Äì A dimensional model where a central fact table is connected to denormalized dimension tables, forming a star-like structure.
* **Snowflake Schema** ‚Äì An extension of the star schema where dimension tables are normalized into multiple related tables, reducing redundancy and increasing data integrity.
* **Fact Table** ‚Äì Contains measurable metrics (e.g., `movie_ratings.rating`).
* **Dimension Table** ‚Äì Provides descriptive attributes (e.g., `movies`, `directors`, `actors`).
* **Normalization** ‚Äì The process of splitting tables to remove redundancy and improve data integrity.

---

## üß±QUERY FORMAT

* **Star Schema:** Denormalized dimension tables directly linked to the fact table.
* **Snowflake Schema:** Normalized dimension tables with separate tables for repeating groups, linked via foreign keys.

---

## üí°TIP TO REMEMBER

* Star schema is easier to query, but snowflake schema is better for data integrity and large datasets.
* Fact tables should only contain metrics and foreign keys to dimensions.
* Use junction tables (`movie_actors`) for many-to-many relationships.

## üí™EXERCISE

Before moving to the exercises, we need a platform with tables and data.
For this, we have a setup file available inside the same directory: [CLICK AND EXECUTE FILE FIRST](https://github.com/code4coin/001-SQL-Structured-Query-Language-/blob/main/001%20SQL%20FOR%20DATA%20ENGINEERS/002%20SAMPLE%20DATA/001%20MOVIE%20DATA.md)
