## üí™EXERCISE

Before moving to the exercises, we need a platform with tables and data.
For this, we have a setup file available inside the same directory: [CLICK AND EXECUTE FILE FIRST](https://github.com/code4coin/001-SQL-Structured-Query-Language-/blob/main/001%20SQL%20FOR%20DATA%20ENGINEERS/002%20SAMPLE%20DATA/001%20MOVIE%20DATA.md)

### 1. Fetch all Sci-Fi movies released after 2010 along with their directors
<details>
<summary>‚úÖ Solution</summary>

```sql
SELECT m.title, d.director_name
FROM movies m
JOIN directors d ON m.director_id = d.director_id
WHERE m.genre = 'Sci-Fi' AND m.release_year > 2010;
```
</details>


### 2. Find the average rating of each movie
<details>
<summary>‚úÖ Solution</summary>

```sql
SELECT m.title, AVG(r.rating) AS avg_rating
FROM movies m
LEFT JOIN movie_ratings r ON m.movie_id = r.movie_id
GROUP BY m.title;
```
</details>


### 3. List all actors who acted in movies directed by Christopher Nolan
<details>
<summary>‚úÖ Solution</summary>

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT a.actor_name
FROM actors a
JOIN movie_actors ma ON a.actor_id = ma.actor_id
JOIN movies m ON ma.movie_id = m.movie_id
JOIN directors d ON m.director_id = d.director_id
WHERE d.director_name = 'Christopher Nolan';
```
</details>


### 4. Retrieve the top 3 highest-rated movies
<details>
<summary>‚úÖ Solution</summary>

```sql
SELECT m.title, AVG(r.rating) AS avg_rating
FROM movies m
JOIN movie_ratings r ON m.movie_id = r.movie_id
GROUP BY m.title
ORDER BY avg_rating DESC
LIMIT 3;
```
</details>


### 5. Count the number of movies in each genre
<details>
<summary>‚úÖ Solution</summary>
