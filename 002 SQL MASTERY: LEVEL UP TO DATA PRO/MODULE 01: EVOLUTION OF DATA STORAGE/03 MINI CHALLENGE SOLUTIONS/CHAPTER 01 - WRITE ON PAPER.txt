Step 1: Record the Guests
 Write down the names of employees in each category:
	Who will drink soft drinks
	Who will drink juice
	Who will consume alcohol
	Who are non-vegetarians
	Who will eat only vegetables

Step 2: Analyze the Data
üìù Intern Exercise: Party Guest List

Here‚Äôs the list of employees and their preferences. Write them down on paper first, then try to answer the questions that follow.

1. Category: DRINK
	Soft drinks: Alice, Bob, David
	Juice: Emma, Grace, Henry
	Alcohol: Bob, Carol, Henry

2. Category: FOOD
	Non-vegetarians: Alice, Carol, Henry
	Vegetarians only: Emma, Grace, David

Challenge Questions:

PROBLEM STATEMENT 01: How many people will drink any kind of drink (soft drinks, juice, or alcohol)?
	ANALYSIS:   
	            Soft: {Alice, Bob, David}; 
	            Juice: {Emma, Grace, Henry};
	            Alcohol: {Bob, Carol, Henry};
	            TOTAL DRINKERS: {Alice, Bob, David, Emma, Grace, Henry, Carol}
	            OBSERVATION: Each category has 3 members, so result should be 3 (category)* 3 (members per category) = 9
			              Interesting, total drinker are 7, why? because few people like Henry is in more than 1 category.
						  
PROBLEM STATEMENT 02: How many will drink juice and eat meat?
	ANALYSIS:  
	            Juice: {Emma, Grace, Henry};
	            Non-vegetarians: {Alice, Carol, Henry};
	            TOTAL JUICE + Non-vegetarians: {Emma, Grace, Henry, Alice, Carol}
	            OBSERVATION: Members in Juice and Non-vegetarians are 3 each, instead of getting total people as 6
						               Our count comes to 5, again why? Its Hengry again (trusty me change the name to HUNGRY, lol)

PROBLEM STATEMENT 03: How many will neither drink alcohol nor eat meat?
	ANALYSIS:  
	            All Employees: {Alice, Bob, David, Emma, Grace, Hengry}
	            Alcohol + Non-vegetarians: {Bob, Carol, Hengry, Alice}
	            Employees having neither {Alcohol + Non-vegetarians}: {All Employees} - {Alcohol + Non-vegetarians} = {David, Emma, Grace}
	            So, such 3 employees avaiable - {David, Emma, Grace}

Note - 
	   1. This exercise uses simple observation and basic set logic (we‚Äôll cover it later in the book).
	   2. With just a few names, observation works fine. But imagine trying the same for 100, 200, or even 1,000 employees!
