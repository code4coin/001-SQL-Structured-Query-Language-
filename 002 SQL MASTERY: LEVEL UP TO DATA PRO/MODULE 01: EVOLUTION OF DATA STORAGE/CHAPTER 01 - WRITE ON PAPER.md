---

## 📖 DEFINITION
> **Paper Records**
- Physical storage of information in notebooks, ledgers, or forms.
- Easy to understand but **time-consuming** and prone to human errors.
- Searching, updating, or aggregating data is **very inefficient**.

---

## 🧱 STORY FORMAT

> **Scenario:**  
Your manager asks you to record details of **1000 employees** manually on paper.  
- You spend days writing.  
- When asked about a single employee, you must scan **all pages manually**.  
- When asked to calculate total salaries, averages, or department stats, it becomes **impractical**.  

> **Lesson:** Paper is **slow, error-prone, and not scalable**.

## 💡 TIP TO REMEMBER
- Manual storage is okay for **tiny datasets**.  
- Always think **how your data will grow** before choosing a storage method.
- This chapter sets the foundation for **why databases exist**.

## 🔍 Observations from the MINI EXERCISES

> **Searching for a single record:** Looking up one record is manageable, but doing it regularly in a large dataset quickly becomes tedious. It highlights the limits of manual searching.

> **Counting employees in a department:** Counting, for example, employees in Finance may seem simple, but a single error can force you to start over. This shows how easy it is to make mistakes with manual tallying.

> **Summing large numbers:** Adding thousands of salaries by hand is impractical—your calculator might not survive! This underscores the need for automated tools to handle computations reliably.
